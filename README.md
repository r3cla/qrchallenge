## My process

### Planning
- I started by analyzing the design files and style guide provided in the Frontend Mentor challenge.
- I planned the layout structure, deciding to use Flexbox for easy centering and alignment.

### Development
- I began with creating the basic HTML structure, ensuring it was semantically correct.
- Next, I linked the Google Font (Outfit) and set up the base styles in my CSS file (`style.css`).
- I then focused on styling the QR code component, starting with mobile dimensions as per the mobile-first approach.
- After getting the mobile layout right, I used media queries to adjust the layout for desktop dimensions.

### Testing
- I tested the layout using firefox responsive design mode to view in different screen sizes.
- I also validated my HTML code using w3.org.

### Reflection
- This project was a great opportunity to practice my CSS layout skills, particularly with Flexbox and responsive design.
- I learned the importance of mobile-first design and how it simplifies the process of making a website responsive.

### Future Improvements
- As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I am planning to delve into more advanced and modern web technologies such as React and Styled-Components.
